# Getting Started on TechDocs


TechDocs is a docs-like-code feature that transforms markdown documentation into HTML and displays it inside Dev Portal.
You can keep your documentation files here in the docs folder and reference them in mkdocs.yml. And with little 
configuration you can get a nice-looking doc site here in Dev Portal.
